### **News**
<!--  -->
- [2023.7.31] We release the codes, checkpoints and gradio demo.

## üåü Run on your videos
To power practical usage, we release the following checkpoints:

| Video Enc.  | Text Enc.  | Pretraining            | Fine-tuning   |  Download |
| ------------------ |  ------------------ | ------------------ | ------- | ---- |
| CLIP-Base | CLIP-Base | 4M      | -      |   [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-eGata6ZPV0A1BBsZpYyIooos9yjMx2f?usp=sharing)  |
| CLIP-Base | CLIP-Base | 4M | QVHL + Charades + NLQ + TACoS + ActivityNet + DiDeMo      |  [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l6RyjGuqkzfZryCC6xwTZsvjWaIMVxIO?usp=sharing)  


Additionally, we've built gradio interfaces for easy interaction. 
Run `python3 main_gradio.py`
